ALICE And I am Alice.
Alice in Wonderland by Sharon Holland 3
EDITH
(Reading with little vocal expression.)
"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favored by the pope, was soon
submitted to by the English. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and
Northumbria, declared for him…
ALICE
What did they declare?
EDITH
(Annoyed.)
It doesn't say. "Edwin and Morcar…
ALICE
(Peering into the book.)
What did they look like?
EDITH
There aren't any pictures. Now, pay attention, Alice.
ALICE
(Yawning)
I am paying attention, but what is the use of a book without pictures?
EDITH
I swear, Alice, there are many wonderful books without pictures.
ALICE
But if I had my way, all books would be filled with pictures.
EDITH
What nonsense!
ALICE
Yes, yes, and filled with nonsense too! I would want a world filled
with nonsense.
EDITH
Alice, now that is enough. "Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and
Northumbria, declared for him, finding it advisable to offer him the
crown. And even Steigend, the archbishop of Canterbury agreed to meet
with William to offer him the crown.”
(ALICE yawns and leans back against the tree as her sister drones on.)
EDITH
(More and more softly.)
“William’s conduct had been of late much accustomed to conquest.
William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his
Normans…
(EDITH "freezes" and the light changes as the WHITE RABBIT, dressed in 
Alice in Wonderland by Sharon Holland 4
a waistcoat and jacket, runs by ALICE; she at first regards him with
little interest.)
ALICE
(Yawning.)
A White Rabbit wearing a waistcoat…
(The WHITE RABBIT pauses and consults his pocketwatch.)
Song: White Rabbit – I’m Late
WHITE RABBIT
(Nervously.)
I’m late, I’m late, I’m very, very late.
I’m late. I’m late, I’m late, I’m very late,
I’m late, I’m late, I’m very late.
ALICE
And looking at his pocketwatch . . . Ho hum…
(She settles back against the tree, closing her eyes. Then she sits up
abruptly, realizing how unusual the situation really is.)
ALICE
A talking rabbit!? With a pocketwatch!? Mr. Rabbit! Wait!
WHITE RABBIT
Oh, my dear paws! She'll be absolutely savage! I’m late!
(He begins to run off and ALICE jumps up and follows him. There is an
extended chase through the theatre)
ALICE
Mr. Rabbit!
WHITE RABBIT
(enters House Left Door 1)
Oh, my fur and whiskers! She'll have me executed! I'm late, I'm late,
I’m late! (exits House Right Door 1)
ALICE
Late for what? Oh, please, please wait! (Alice runs after the White
Rabbit.)
WHITE RABBIT DOUBLE
(enters House Right Door 2)
I’m late! I’m late! I’m late! (exits HL Door 2 as Alice runs up to him)
WHITE RABBIT
(enters House Right Door 1)
I’m late! I’m late! I’m late! (exits House Left Door 1, Alice runs
after White Rabbit and also exits House Left Door 1)

Where did he go?

(White Rabbit and Alice chase through House)
WHITE RABBIT
(Hysterically.)
Sure as ferrets are ferrets, she'll have me beheaded! (To AUDIENCE.)
Then I really will be late! (He dives down the rabbit-hole.)
ALICE
(Running up to the rabbit-hole.)
Wait, Mr. Rabbit!
